<p align = "center">ðŸ’¡ A 35-hour mega course to take you from beginner to advanced in Python.</p>

## Getting started now

Enrol in the course by going to [this link](https://go.tecla.do/cpc).

Then come back here and download the entire repository. If you are familiar with Git, you can use Git to download it. Otherwise, you can download it as a zip file:

Next, start taking the course at the beginning! You can use the downloaded code files to support you while you go through the course.

I also **strongly recommend** you code while you take the course. A good strategy is:

1. Watch the video intently, optionally while taking notes.
2. Watch again, more quickly, while typing the code together with me.
3. Once you're done with the video, play about with the code. Make changes, break things, then fix them, and try to thoroughly understand everything the code does.

If you do this for the entire course, I guarantee you will learn Python well. You'll still be using Google and searching for stuff every day, but so does everyone else!
